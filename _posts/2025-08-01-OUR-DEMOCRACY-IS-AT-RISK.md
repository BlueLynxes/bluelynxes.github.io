# Our Democracy is at Risk!

It has unfortunately happened, out democracy is now at risk.
In some Western countries what remains is barely anything more than an illusion, but truthfully, we are losing.

No, I'm not talking about Trump, the fact that Trump has been elected is a demostration of the fact that democracy still exists, in fact.
And him pursuing the goals he promised to his citizens means that Americans got what they wanted and they should celebrate that, those who oppose him to the point of attempting sabotaging him are not democratic if not for their party name.
Democracy also means accepting that someone elses won and that now they are going to decide.

But this is not about the U.S., this is about the U.K. and the E.U., it's about Europe, the other part of the West.

# Situation in the U.K.

It is likely that you already know by now what is going on in the U.K. I'll give you a quick ordered rundown:

1. Mass illegal migration.
2. Subsidies to support said migration.
3. Making a law that allows people to be arrested due to saying something.
4. Making a law that allows people to be arrested for "praying" even in their private homes. Except muslims, these can pray whever of course.
5. Not arresting pedophiles gang who have been raping little girls because _it goes against the narrative_ that getting a billion illegal migrants with no background checks is a good idea.
6. Asking tech companies to put backdoors in conversation systems so the government can look into peoples private conversations at any time.
7. Imposing a law that requires websites to do face and ID scans before being allowed to proceed and check the content in question. For the children, of course. After all they can be raped by gangs but not log in on Discord according to the U.K. prime minister and prime idiot.

From this quick rundown, it should be clear that things are getting out of control. After seeing a video of a U.K. policemen attempting to drive over a fellow brit protesting I've decided that the CCP is officially less bad than the U.K.

I mean sure, China has a shit firewall that blocks half the Internet, yet Apple is still a safe encrypted channel (everything else is not, though) and they don't require your ID every two seconds. Plus, and this is a big plus, you won't get raped nor stabbed by the illegal migrants.
I mean look, the fact that China deems islam (lower case i intended) a mental disease evidently shows that there is some problem. But beside that, the crime rates and the demografic of these crimes show the problem.

Failing happens, but hiding failure by creating censorship laws is against the very principles that made the West what it is.
There is a reason if Russia is Russia, China is China, North Korea is North Korea and the Middle East is whatever it is, and then there is a reason if the West is the West. And the reason is that we pursued freedom of speech and respect.
Today however, we are trying to import illegal migrants who did not grow up with our principles and our culture, who do not care, who want to piggyback on our society while they destroy it with their _"values"_.

I mean how we say that we believe that women should have freedom of speech, right to vote, work, and be independent, and then we want to introduce islam rules and principles in our schools and letting them govern us.

And that aside, **who wants this**?
Who wanted the Online Safety Act? Who wanted backdoors in private conversations? _Politcians did_, at no point the population has been asked if the decision that was about to be made was fine or not.
And there is a simple reason why this is the case, and the reason is that the U.K., like most of the West, is truly an Oligarchy where every now and then we pick a new ruler who can ignore what we say.

Starmer is PM? Well he can decide now, no need to bother with the population or anything anymore. And now that the king is as spineless as he is with a royal family that has an impact almost equivalent to what karens posting on twitter have, it's not wonder the U.K. is becoming the new CCP.

# What about the EU?

Not too different. I have voted for my government, and I have voted for who would represent my country in the EU parliament. We won both elections, who I voted is governing me and is representing me in the EU parliament, and it was all for nothing.

The other party still has too much power to do whatever they want and block my government in doing what I voted, like many other, them to do. Sometimes their solution to block the government is to use the EU.

Why the EU? Why should people elected by other countries, with other cultures and with other interests and needs have any say in how we regulate ourselves in here?

And this applies to everything. What I can buy on a store, where can I invest my money, how much taxes I pay, what degree of privacy can I have on the Internet. It's all dictated first and foremost by the EU. It doesn't matter if my government is against it, the EU decides. And with EU I mean the barely still alive France and the self destroying Germany.

We worry about a green deal that seems to have been though of by a toddler, and I mean, considering people like Thunberg it's not wonder really. Destroying our economies and bending at 90 degrees ready for the Chinese to fuck us thanks to their cheap, not environmentally friendly vehicles built with slavery like labour.
Thankfully indians are too busy catching deseases from shit rivers before they can produce anything, or we would let them, too.

Yes because letting our enemies destroy us if the first goal. US? Bad! EU countries? Bad! China? Good! Iran! Even better! Palestine! Hell yeah some nice terrorists! What about Russia? Well that's where we gotta get our gas from!

Like fucking damnit guys, everyone is about green here and green there, yet, we all lied to ourselves by saying we'd be more green by buying gas from fucking Russia, a dictatorship, as an excuse to not fucking build nuclear power plants all over Europe.

Then we have the going dark issue with fucking insane EU people wanting to spy on us, why? Because. Who asked for it? Politicians. Why? I don't know. Aside from being power hungry I really don't know. What is the purpose if we let terrorists walk in anyway?

# The US

Only outlier here is the US, which after the retarded government of Biden managed to get Trump. Is he good, is he bad? Quite frankly I don't know, but he's better than someone who claims to be indian one day and black another. I'd much rather see someone with an actual idea of what he's doing than one that has a political stance more liquid than the nationality and genders of the other half of the population who voted her.

ICE is bad? ICE is doing exactly what Americans fucking wanted, and I wish I had ICE here, I wich my government could actually do what I voted it to do, but nope, because bureaucracy, because bullshit.

At least we should be more similar to Switzerland, where referendums are used to actually let the population be part of the choices made. A population that is smart, educated and able to make decisions; somethingt that we were not before and we definitely won't be tomorrow, when the official language of France will be something from Africa. Yet to decide if it's going to be arabic or whatever else.

# Payment Processors

Payment processors are another recent case of why our democracy doesn't really matter.
Look, I love companies, they are great, corporations are one of the things that allowed us to thrive as a society and give the nice things we all know and love.
That being said, there should be a public counter part here.

Payment processors don't just offer a "service", they control an infrastructure that cannot be replaced by anyone, not even the government. The laws of one country may be abused and propagated elsewhere. Like what happened with the whole censorship bullshit from Visa and Mastercard. Whatever amount of shit they get they deserve.

This is of course the result of ESG, wanting to put morals and other vague bullshit in stock prices was a bad idea, and it ultimately lead to what essentially market manipulation through seeking scandals that look good for rating agencies. If this isn't ridiculous I don't know what is.

At the very least have the decency of making a law against censorship, but I mean, after Starmer, the EU, and the previous US government, I see why we don't have such a law.

# Fight for Freedom of Speech

Remember, the reason why we thrived as a society is simple, and it's called respect.

Respect of our own culture, respect of the other members of our society. A respect that drove us to protect it from outsiders who did not want to respect it, but that led those who wanted to share it integrate with us.
A respect that, even though I'm not a religious person, was found in Christianity. Moderate Christians don't tell you what to do or not to do, but they do fight for basic decency and for respect of the others, which are values that should, in theory, share within our own countries; even though they seem to be long gone.

Freedom of speech is a product of respect, it exists because we respect the fact that others can disagree. And freedom of speech is the reason why we managed to develop new, advanced technologies, that ultimately led us to be the best there is in the world.

Now that freedom of speech, though, and that respect are put in danger. Because of people like Starmer, because of a European Union that managed to ignore the governments of the member states and impose their own laws at the convenience of a few and for the damage of many.

This article itself may be removed.
I did not commit any crime in my own country, I didn't hurt anyone. Yet Microsoft's ESG score would beg to disagree, and the UK police would already be at my home to arrest me.

Therefore, as long as this article is up, a massive fuck you to those that allowed the situation to become what it became.
